# SO-Logger
A simple SO wrapper for logging based off of Jason Storey's software architecture video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh7f4K9Wbj8&t=14s).

Created through the context menu under "Logging". Scriptable objects of the logger can be created and then referenced through the inspector. The implementation was expanded on using scriptable objects so the need for logger game objects in each scene is removed. Instead, they can be put straight in the project folders to be reused.
